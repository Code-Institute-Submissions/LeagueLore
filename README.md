# League Lore.

to get basic information on any champion in the game.  There is an option for different languages to allow for a larger variety 
of users.

# UX

To make a responsive website that starter League of Legends players can use to view information on champions within the game.

Balsamiq was used to create the following wireframe:

## The Strategy Plane

The objective is to create a site with the goal to let new and experienced players of League of Legends be able to view the base information
on the champions within the game. The immediate requirements are a search bar and language option for non native speakers, a grid to display 
all current champions within the game and an information page that appears to display information on the selected champion along with a spotlight
video using the youtube API to search for the video.

## The Scope Plane

The website's requirement will be to allow as much choice to the user as possible. Therefore to acheive this a dropdown is available for the user to change language,
a search bar with autocomplete function for users to look for champions that they know the name of or part of the name, a grid that the user can browse available champions in the game
and a contact page where users can submit ideas on what else they would like to see on the site.
